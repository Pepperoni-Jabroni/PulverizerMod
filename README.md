- Sounds

- Full Comparator integration
- Full Hopper integration
   - Top side: Insert Input
   - Bottom side: Extract Output
   - Left side: Insert Diamond
   - Back/Right side: Insert Fuel
- Full Datapack support for new Recipes (see Example)

## Purpose

The Pulverizer has a number of uses, which are:
1. Double resulting output from pulverizeable crafting recipes.
   - Tired of crafting all those Bones into Bone Meal manually? Automate it and get more value with a Pulverizer!
   - Blaze Rods
2. Crush stone blocks into their pulverized siblings. Sand & clay are finally renewable! This is also an alterantive new renewable Gravel source in comparison to Piglin Trading.
   - Cobblestone -> Gravel -> Sand -> Clay
3. Make dyes more generically farmable. You can pulverize any dyed: Wool, Terracotta, Glazed Terracotta, Concrete Powder, Concrete, & Stained Glass *into* their respecitive Dye.
4. Usefully recycle full-durability Iron & Gold Tools & Armors into a full *ingot*.
5. Give you **extreme value for Silk Touched Overworld Ores**
   - Each output is modelled off a maximum-luck Fortune III roll.
   - You can now get 4 ingots from respective Iron & Gold Ores!
   - Coal, Diamond, & Emerald Ores will yield 4 respective items!
   - Redstone Ore will yield 6 Redstone & Lapis Ore will yield 16 Lapis Lazuli!

| Any Gold/Iron Tool/Armor                                   | Respective Ingot | 1     |

| Lapis Ore                                                  | Lapis Lazuli     | 16    |

## Cost

The obvious cost to using the Pulverizer is that it's powered by diamonds in addition to traditional fuels, like a Furnace. Each diamond powers the Pulverizer for 1561 uses (the same amount as a Diamond Pickaxe has durability).

One additional cost is that no Experience is generated with usage, a small cost to pay for increased Iron/Gold Ingot production.
